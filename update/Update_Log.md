To further improve physical consistency, 

I replaced heat transfer module by set of energy balance equations, 

Start from version 2.0.0

# ðŸ§  [2.0.1] 2025 May 10
Add another parameter: "envelop_mdl", 

Allow user to use the new physics based module or previous data driven module. 

# ðŸ§  [2.0.2] 2025 May 10
Fix bug due to parameter: "envelop_mdl",

Vectorize calculation,speed improved by ~6 times.

# ðŸ§  [3.0.0] 2025 June 11
Update datadriven modnn
RC based envelop_mdl really hard to tune on new dataset

# ðŸ§  [3.0.1] 2025 June 11
Add a step function for one step ahead prediction

# ðŸ§  [3.0.2] 2025 June 11
Fix bug for step function

# ðŸ§  [3.0.3] 2025 June 11
Fix bug for step function

# ðŸ§  [3.0.4] 2025 Sept 10
Didn't work on it for 3 months, just update the latest version
Will use it for BESTOpt building dynamic model

# ðŸ§  [3.0.5] 2025 Sept 15
3.0.4 CAN-NOT work at all, I mistakenly comment one line and add a new line of code
3.0.5 is GOOD, will use it for BESTOpt dynamic modeling
