# Modularized Physical Incorporated Neural Network for Future Building Energy Modeling

This repository proposed a Modularized Physical Incorporated Neural Network (SeqPINN) for Future Building Energy Modeling, which can be used for 1) load prediction, 2) dynamic modeling, 3) retrofit and 4) energy optimization. 
The "physical prior knoweldge" is incorperated from the following four aspects: 1) a heat balance-incorporated model structure (inspired by heat balance equations where we use different NNs to represent each heat balance terms), 2) encoder-decoder structure (inspired by state space model so we can conduct energy optimization easy), 3) model parameters constraints (make sure the model can response correctly) and 4) modular design (inspired by Lego brick)   


## Instruction

Feel free to use your own dataset, you just need to change your column names and then you can start to play with Run.py file
More detailed infomation coming soon, I will try to update at least once a week.

## Related publications

I hope it can come soon...
